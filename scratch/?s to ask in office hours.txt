strcmp compares contents of string1 and string2
if return value is < 0 then it indicates string1 is less than string2

if Return value is > 0 then it indicates string2 is less than string1

if Return value is = 0 then it indicates string1 is equal to string2

sometimes order of evaluation for if statements matter in 1e)

ask Manny about 2a

unsigned # range: 0 - 2^n - 1
sign & mag: -(2^(n-1) - 1) to (2^(n-1) - 1), with +- zero
one comp: −(2^(N−1) − 1) to 2^(N−1) − 1 
two comp: −(2^(N−1)) to 2^(N−1) − 1

for number representation questions remember range, and if they ask if we can use more numbers say n to represent base 2, it is 2^(n + n) - 1 always

malloc first fit finds first available memory space and stores stuff there

malloc next fit finds first available memory space after the last thing enetered that (our thing) can be next to and stores stuff there

malloc best fit find first best available memory and stores there

for these problems look up, draw it out using array representation

remember return value is stored in v0 by convention in function calls

do ?4 later in sp10

when converting hex to binary you look at last six bits I think
when subtracting hexadecimals when borrowing its one group of sixteen + current number
when adding the one that goes to next column is just 1 for adding purposes so add normally
when subtracting and borrowing consecutively from 0 it starts at 16 always not 1 less so if its 15 this turns to 14 but the next one is 16 not 13

so for division I think you must add 2 numbers together ex 1EF8/4 
1 + E = the one in this instance represents 16, so 16 + E(14) = 30. 4 goes into 30, 7 times. 

Ignore top correct way first compute result in divisor so ex 38 = 3 * 16(first digit calculation) = 48 + 8 = 56. in ex. to get number that 4 goes into 38. First, break 38 into how many 16 parts it has, so this 3. so 16 * 3 = 48, then you need 8(from second digit) to get 56. To get from 4 to 56, simply divide 56 / 4 to get 14 or E in hex.

When figuring out address of label if the current address is greater than the label then we know it is negative, so we must compute 2’s complement

remember r format its arguments first then destination, while i format its destination then argument
jump address is computed backwards by first concatenating “00” at the end to make it a word address.
concatenate the uppermost 4 bits of current PC (which is now PC + 4)
example of doing this in video around 9:08
remember jr is an R-type instruction for this 


for cheat sheet write equivalent. 2^-4 = 0.0625, 2^-6 = .015625

ask which is correct? (DestAddr - PC - 4) / 4 or (PC + 4 - DestAddr) / 4
