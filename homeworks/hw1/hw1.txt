Problem 2 

a. 
x & 0 = 0
x & 1 = x
x | 0 = x
x | 1 = 1
x ^ 0 = x
x ^ 1 = not x

b.
1. turning bits OFF? To turn off bits you would use And operator.(x & 0) 
2. turning bits ON? To turn on bits you would use or operator. (x | 1)
3. flipping bits? To flip bits you would use xor operator. (x ^ 1)

c.
1.  ((0b01010101 << 3) & 0xAE) | 2 = I think it is 170
2.  x << 4 = x * 16
3.  x >> 1 = x / 2
4.  y = x | (1<<n) 


Problem 3 

a.
1. CHOICE: One’s complement
   EXPLANATION: Because two’s complement only has one single representation of zero, while one’s complement provides two.
2. CHOICE: Unsigned because it has 256 possible numbers ranging from 0 to 255 for a total of 256 numbers, while in sign & magnitude there is a total of 255 numbers from the range of -127 to 127.
   EXPLANATION: Unsigned representation has no negative range although it does have a bigger positive range, but sign & magnitude provides a range for negative and positive numbers.
3. CHOICE: Sign & Magnitude
   EXPLANATION: With two’s complement although you have one zero, you have an extra negative term -128 not included in the positive side while the range of sign and magnitude is from -127 to 127.
4. CHOICE: Both
   EXPLANATION: You are not allowed negative number representations in unsigned. #change later

b.
  Step 1: Check if the leftmost(most significant) bit is either one or zero for both numbers, by doing something like this (int msb = (m & 0xff) >> 7;) where you perform and operator on m with 8 bits of ones. And then it shifts the result to the right by seven leaving either 1 or 0.
  Step 2: if a > b, in other words if a is one and b is zero, then we know b is bigger because it is a positive number where as a is a negative number.
  Step 3: However, if they are equal, then you look at each number in base 10, and the number that is bigger in base 10, is as a result smaller than the other number. Or other approach just compare from leftmost bit shifting to the right by one and comparing until one of them is zero and other is 1, then you know the one with zero is bigger. If they are both 1, then to determine the smaller number, you want to identify the number with the bigger magnitude, so to do this you take the two’s complement for both numbers for this particular case and compare them as usual.
