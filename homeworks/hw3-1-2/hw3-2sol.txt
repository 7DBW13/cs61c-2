SOLUTIONS
2.
a. 
37.75: 100101.11
Exponent field: 5 + 31 = 36 = 100100 
Sign field: 1 because we have a negative number
1 100100 00101110â€¦0 = 0xC85C0000

b.
0x98765000
1 001100 00111011001010â€¦0
Sign: negative
Exponent: 12 - 31 = -19
Value = -1 * 2^(-19)*(1.00111011001010) = -.000002348
c.
Limited by mantissa, has 25 bits
=> can represent integers up to 0b10{26} = 2^26
So the smallest positive integer we CANNOT represent is 2^26+1 = 67108865

d. 
Exponent field: 000001
So exponent is 1 - 31 = -30
2^-30 

e. 
2^-30 * 2^-25 (1 as least significant bit) 
2^-55

3.
a. 11
b. 0x74 0x76 0x77
c. Any address with an index of 5 where the index is the 3 least sig. bits of address>>2.
d. 51

4.
a.
100%
Explanation:
Every access is a conflict with the previous.

b.
100%, 67%
Explanation:
100% if element 0, 255, and 510 all map to the same block. This can happen if 0 maps to
the middle of a block.
67% if element 0 maps to the beginning of a cache block. Then 255 and 510 would map to the block
"before" it.
